## Implementation of 4-point DFT ##

In mathematics, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function 
into a same length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency.
The interval at which the DFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.
