## Implement Sampling and Quantization ##

The sampled signal values are represented by a finite set of integer values. 
This is known as quantization.
Rounding of a number is a simple example of quantization.

Higher the spatial resolution of the image, greater is the sampling rate, i.e., lower is the image area represented by each sample point.
Similaryy, higher the grey level resolution of the image, more are the numebr of quantization levels.

Thus, spatial resolution gives us an indication of the sampling while grey level resolution gives us an indication of the quantization.

> Spatial resolution --> Sampling

> Grey level resolution --> Quantization

In an image, the x-axis is the number of samples(pixels) while the y-axis is the grey level of each sample(quantization).
The resolution reduces as the number of samples reduce.
