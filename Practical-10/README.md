## Implementation of Histogram Processing ##

**Histogram** is the graphical representation of the intensity distribution of an image.
In simple terms, it represents the number of pixels for each intensity value considered.

Here in this practical we try to implement **Histogram Equalization**

- **Histogram equalization** is a computer image processing technique used to improve contrast in images. 
- It accomplishes this by effecively spreading out the most frequent intensity values, i.e., stretching out the intensity range of the image.
- This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data is represented by close contrast values.
- This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.
