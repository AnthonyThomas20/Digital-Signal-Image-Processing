## Load, Save and Display an image in Octave

**Loading an image**

- The first step in most image processing tasks is to load an image in Octave. This is done using the **imread(image_path)** function.

**Saving the image**

- We can save images in Octave using the **imwrite** function which is the corresponding function for writing images to the disk.

**Displaying the image**

- The loaded images are displayed in a separate window in Octave. The **imshow(image)** function is used for this.
